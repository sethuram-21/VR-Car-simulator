**VR Car Simulator**

This is a two-player car simulation built with Unity. The project allows two players to control different cars in a city environment. The game is designed for both VR and non-VR users.

**About the Project**

In this project, two players can control cars using different control schemes:
1) Player 1 uses the WASD keys.
2) Player 2 uses the IJKL keys.
